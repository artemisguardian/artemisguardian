Digital art generally refers to artistic work created using digital technology. Unlike traditional artwork, digital art is more flexible when it comes to the form of expression. The original carrier of digital art is data. As the carrier of digital art, data can be easily replicated and spread but lacks asset property. This leads to the biggest difference between digital art and traditional art business models: when it comes to traditional fine art, one can trade the actual artwork, whereas it is difficult to trade the physical-digital artwork.
The way in which digital artworks are distributed also leads to copyright issues, as the copyright information is easily lost in the process of dissemination. Sometimes users and art lovers can't find the proper way to pay for artwork when they want to. Moreover, digital artworks are circulated internationally. It may be difficult for traditional institutions to provide a marketplace for such trading.
NFT can serve as a transactional ‘entity' for digital art by mapping the file of certain digital artwork, making it a perfect digital art carrier. In today's market, Artemis combines NFT with digital art, creating a new revenue model where NFT is traded as the digital artwork itself. In such trading, NFT is not only traded as copyright or ownership but also serves as a unique link between the artist and the collector. NFT is what the artist acknowledges to be the essence of his work.
In the past, an artist was only paid once when his work was sold by him for the first time. When his work changed hands again and was sold for an exorbitant price, the artist couldn't benefit from it. NFT has changed the situation by offering digital artists the special right to profit from their work when it is sold for the second time.
